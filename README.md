- Idea and design based on LMOracle: https://handbookhmm.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=42. Thanks to it's author - AlexSpl
- Some information about tree generation can be found here: http://heroescommunity.com/viewthread.php3?TID=17812&pagenumber=12
- This program does NOT interact with Hota memory!
- It's just a help resource, like Heroes3 assist (https://www.heroes3assist.com/) that can calculate tree number from a given first level-ups and build a specific tree.
- To run binary release you need 64bit win > win7, or you can install python and pyside6 and run main.py 
- I know about rule that skilltree view in program is illegal in online games.
And this rule was added (how i think) because of LMOracle program,
that can read tree number from memory of the program.
In my opinion, all programs that interact with memory of the game should be illegal in online.
But all other calculators (and this calculator program) must be legal.
All players should be in equal conditions and choose whether to use calculators or not.
- You can use Herostate class and it's methods in your programs, if you wish, but i only ask to mention HotaTreeCalc by Temig and LMOracle by AlexSpl.
